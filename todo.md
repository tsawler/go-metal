# Go-Metal Project Future Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the go-metal project, building upon its current "production-ready" status and addressing known limitations. The plan is structured into logical phases, prioritizing stability and foundational features before expanding into advanced capabilities and broader ecosystem integration.

## Executive Summary

The go-metal framework has achieved significant milestones, delivering a high-performance, Apple Silicon-optimized training system. The roadmap focuses on solidifying its core, expanding its utility for common machine learning tasks, and ultimately positioning it as a comprehensive, competitive ML framework.

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Stability & Foundational Features (Immediate - Next 1-3 Months)

This phase prioritizes resolving existing limitations and implementing fundamental features essential for robust, production-grade training.

* **Core Training Enhancements:**

    * ✅ **Learning Rate Decay/Scheduling:** ~~Implement various learning rate scheduling strategies (e.g., step decay, exponential decay, cosine annealing) to improve model convergence and generalization.~~ **COMPLETED** - Full LR scheduler interface with 5 implementations (StepLR, ExponentialLR, CosineAnnealingLR, ReduceLROnPlateau, NoOp) integrated with ModelTrainer.

    * **Checkpoint Saving & Loading:** Develop robust mechanisms to save and load model weights, optimizer states, and training progress, enabling interruption and resumption of training.

    * ✅ **Advanced Layer Types:** ~~Integrate additional common neural network layers such as Batch Normalization, Dropout, and other advanced activation functions (e.g., Leaky ReLU, ELU).~~ **NEARLY COMPLETED** 
      * **Dropout:** Fully implemented with MPSGraph integration, comprehensive testing, and overfitting reduction validated (25+ point gap reduced to ~17 points)
      * **Batch Normalization:** Fully implemented with complete MPSGraph integration, proper gradient computation, parameter initialization (gamma=1.0, beta=0.0), tensor broadcasting for 4D inputs, and production validation. Training stability and generalization improvements confirmed (validation accuracy 73.80%, controlled 19.49% train-val gap vs 25.3% without BatchNorm)
      * **Leaky ReLU:** Fully implemented with configurable negative slope parameter, complete MPSGraph `leakyReLUWithTensor` integration, comprehensive testing, and real-world financial prediction demo. Demonstrates improved gradient flow for negative inputs (0.184687 vs 0.196875 loss). Still needed: ELU.

    * **Model Serialization:** Implement capabilities to save trained models to disk and load them back for inference or further training.

    * **Further Performance Optimization:** Continuously profile and optimize existing components to squeeze out additional performance gains.

    * ✅ **Debug Output Cleanup:** ~~Clean up verbose debug logging for production use.~~ **COMPLETED** - Removed debug messages from CGO bridge files, console output now shows clean training progress only.

### Phase 2: Core Library Expansion & Utilities (Short-to-Medium Term - Next 3-6 Months)

This phase focuses on building out the core utility of the `go-metal` library by extracting validated components and expanding its fundamental machine learning capabilities.

* **Extract CNN & Image Processing Library Components:** Generalize and integrate the high-performance image processing and data loading utilities validated in the cats-dogs application into the main `go-metal` library.

    * **Image Preprocessing Package (`go-metal/vision/preprocessing`):** High-performance JPEG decoding, resizing, CHW format conversion, and float32 normalization with buffer reuse.

    * **High-Performance Data Loading (`go-metal/vision/dataloader`):** Memory-efficient batch data loading with smart image caching, buffer reuse, and automatic shuffling.

    * **Dataset Management Utilities (`go-metal/vision/dataset`):** Tools for directory-based dataset loading, train/validation splitting, and class distribution analysis.

    * **Enhanced Training Infrastructure (`go-metal/training/session`):** Components for real accuracy calculation, performance monitoring, and professional progress reporting.

    * **Memory Optimization Patterns (`go-metal/memory/optimization`):** Generalized buffer pooling and lifecycle management for various data types to reduce allocations.

* **Expand Core ML Functionality:**

    * **More Optimizers:** Add support for other popular optimization algorithms like RMSprop, Adagrad, and potentially more advanced ones like L-BFGS.

    * **Common Loss Functions:** Implement a broader range of loss functions, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Binary Cross-Entropy with Logits (BCEWithLogitsLoss), Categorical Cross-Entropy, and Huber Loss.

    * **Evaluation Metrics:** Provide a comprehensive set of evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, such as F1-score, Precision, Recall, AUC, and Mean Average Precision (mAP).

### Phase 3: Advanced Architectures & Scalability (Medium-to-Long Term - Next 6-12+ Months)

This phase aims to enable the `go-metal` framework to handle more complex model architectures and scale to larger datasets and computational demands.

* **Transformer Support:** Implement core components and layers necessary for building Transformer architectures, including attention mechanisms, multi-head attention, and encoder/decoder blocks.

* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Add support for recurrent layers like LSTMs and GRUs for sequential data processing.

* **Multi-GPU Support:** Develop strategies for model and data parallelism to leverage multiple GPUs for accelerated training on larger models and datasets.

* **Production Tools:** Build out tools for model deployment and serving infrastructure, making it easier to integrate trained `go-metal` models into production applications.

* **Mobile Integration:** Further optimize for iOS/macOS deployment, potentially including tools for model quantization or conversion for on-device inference.

### Phase 4: Ecosystem & Extensibility (Long Term - 12+ Months)

The final phase focuses on positioning `go-metal` as a versatile and integrated part of the broader machine learning ecosystem.

* **Universal ML Framework:** Continue expanding to support a wider array of machine learning tasks and architectures beyond deep learning, such as traditional ML algorithms.

* **Custom Layer SDK:** Provide a software development kit (SDK) that allows users to define and integrate their own custom layer types and Metal operations.

* **Cloud Integration:** Explore capabilities for distributed training across multiple machines, potentially integrating with cloud-based ML platforms.

* **Ecosystem Integration:** Develop tools for seamless import and export of models to and from other popular frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
