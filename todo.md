## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1: Stability & Foundational Features (Immediate - Next 1-3 Months)

This phase prioritizes resolving existing limitations and implementing fundamental features essential for robust, production-grade training.

* **Core Training Enhancements:**

    * ✅ **Learning Rate Decay/Scheduling:** ~~Implement various learning rate scheduling strategies (e.g., step decay, exponential decay, cosine annealing) to improve model convergence and generalization.~~ **COMPLETED** - Full LR scheduler interface with 5 implementations (StepLR, ExponentialLR, CosineAnnealingLR, ReduceLROnPlateau, NoOp) integrated with ModelTrainer.

    * ✅ **Checkpoint Saving & Loading:** **COMPLETED** - Robust checkpoint mechanisms implemented and validated:
      * ✅ Save/load model weights with complete state preservation
      * ✅ Optimizer state persistence (Adam momentum, variance, step count)
      * ✅ Training progress tracking (epoch, loss history, best accuracy)
      * ✅ Interruption and resumption of training from any checkpoint
      * ✅ Cross-session training continuity with preserved learning rates and schedules

    * ✅ **Advanced Layer Types:** ~~Integrate additional common neural network layers such as Batch Normalization, Dropout, and other advanced activation functions (e.g., Leaky ReLU, ELU).~~ **COMPLETED**
      * **Dropout:** Fully implemented with MPSGraph integration, comprehensive testing, and overfitting reduction validated (25+ point gap reduced to ~17 points)
      * ✅ **Batch Normalization:** **COMPLETED** with unified training/inference solution. Complete MPSGraph integration with proper gradient computation, parameter initialization (gamma=1.0, beta=0.0), tensor broadcasting for 4D inputs, production validation, and comprehensive ONNX compatibility. Implemented unified solution resolving training/inference mode conflicts:
        * **Training Mode:** Uses batch statistics with placeholder-based running statistics updates
        * **Inference Mode:** Uses constants to avoid MPSGraph placeholder errors
        * **ONNX Support:** Full import/export of BatchNorm layers including running statistics extraction and filtering  
        * **Weight Management:** Proper separation of learnable parameters (14) from running statistics (6) during model loading

        * **Both Applications Work:** Cats-dogs training and load-saved-model inference operate simultaneously without conflicts
        * **⚠️ ARCHITECTURAL LIMITATION:** Currently uses ONNX standard defaults (mean=0, variance=1) for inference mode instead of actual trained running statistics.
