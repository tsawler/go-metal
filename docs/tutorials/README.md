## üìã Before You Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19 or later installed
- macOS with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
- Basic understanding of neural networks
- Familiarity with Go programming

### Setup Check
```bash
# Verify Go installation
go version

# Clone go-metal (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/tsawler/go-metal.git
cd go-metal

# Run tests to verify setup
go test ./...
```

## üí° Tutorial Tips

### Running Examples
Each tutorial includes complete, runnable code examples. To run an example:

```bash
# Save the example code to a file (e.g., main.go)
# Run it with:
go run main.go
```

### Common Patterns
All tutorials follow these patterns:
1. **Import necessary packages**
2. **Initialize Metal device and memory**
3. **Build and compile model**
4. **Prepare data**
5. **Train and evaluate**
6. **Clean up resources**

### Debugging Help
If you encounter issues:
- Check error messages carefully
- Ensure proper cleanup with `defer` statements
- Monitor memory usage
- Use smaller batch sizes if needed
- Refer to **[Troubleshooting Guide](../guides/troubleshooting.md)**
