### 7. Learning Rate Scheduler ✅ RESOLVED
**Location:** `training/model_trainer.go:1532`
**Issue:** Dynamic LR changes only update config, not actual scheduler
**Impact:** Learning rate scheduling may not work as expected
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Affects training dynamics
**Resolution:** Implemented complete GPU-resident learning rate scheduler system with:
- Added UpdateLearningRate() method to ModelTrainingEngine that delegates to appropriate optimizer
- Enhanced SetLearningRate() in ModelTrainer to update both config and optimizer state
- Fixed SetEpoch() and StepSchedulerWithMetric() to properly update optimizer learning rates
- Added updateSchedulerStep() method for automatic step-based scheduler updates

**Impact:** Type safety concerns, potential runtime errors
